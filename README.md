- In the Windows startup menu, use the searchbar and type "Remote" and open remote desktop connection
- Another method of opening the application is to go through your system settings, click System, and make your way over to the Remote Desktop tab.

- Once the application opens, in the computer slot you would type in the IP address of the system you are trying to connect to. As the application says, you will be asked for credentials once you establish a connection.
- The connection will only work on a valid IP address, and if the system itself is operating, or else you would not be able to connect.

- Enter the username and password of the system you are trying to connect to. Click OK, then yes for allowing access, and the Remote connection should establish.

- You will see that you are logging in just as a normal PC, but the blue banner indicates you are on a remote connection to that IP address from your own device. You and the end user both have access to the system, and you can now install applications, run command prompt or search on the web on another computer while still being at your home location.
