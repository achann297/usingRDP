<p>
RDP is used in different ways and for different purposes. For instance, a Single Help Desk worker could use RDP for a consumer ticket over a live phone call in order to test the network or edit some settings to find the root cause of the consumer's issue right away. A company can have a worker manage multiple servers, which would be a Remote Desktop Connection Manager, and they can keep up with each different computer remotely to check on servers and sata and make sure everything is good and running, rather than having to get in to each computer directly. RDP is a convieniency for accessing a computer without always having to be present at that computer's location.
